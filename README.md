# azudio-web-app-archetype

This application template is designed to get you up to speed as quickly as possible and to provide examples of using various technologies ready for you to modify.

The application is built as a Single-Page Application where all interaction with the server is done asyncronusly but does not aim to be 100% restful. 

The main client side technoloty used is the Dojo Toolkit comprising of its AMD loader and the Dijit GUI library, therefore Tapestry is configured not to use the out-of-the-box Bootstrap/jQuery stack.
